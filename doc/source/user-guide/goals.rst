=============
 Flexibility
=============

ConvergeUI is designed to be flexible to the developer's needs.  By providing a set of web assets that can be dynamically incorporated into the project, the developer is free to configure and combine only what pieces are desired.  Further, due to the variety of build systems, compilation that may be necessary (e.g. compass compiling SCSS or asset managers such as Jammit).

==============
 Common Style
==============

ConvergeUI sets out to provide a look and feel that can be used across multiple applications to provide users with the feeling that they are using a connective set of elements.

=================
 Configurability
=================

Using the power of SCSS variables and mixins, and *content_for* blocks within the layouts, ConvergeUI provides the ability to configure sizing, color themes, sections of content and functionality.
