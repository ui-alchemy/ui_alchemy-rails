Welcome to ConvergeUI's documentation!
======================================

ConvergeUI is an asset repository for web resources that also includes a number of HAML layouts and styling.  This layouts and styling are designed to be customizable and flexible depending on the project's needs.  The easiest way to use ConvergeUI is as a git submodule in your own project and an example of this can be seen within the ConvergeUI Example app.
